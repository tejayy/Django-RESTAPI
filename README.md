# Django Python Project

This repository contains the project materials and code examples for the "Django Python Project" on Udemy. The project is designed to help you build a fully functional web application using the Django framework with Python.

## Project Description

The "Django Python Project" is a hands-on project that allows you to apply your Django skills and knowledge to develop a web application from scratch. The project covers various aspects of Django, including models, views, templates, forms, authentication, and deployment.

Throughout the project, you will:

- Design and implement the data models for your application using Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
- Create views and templates to handle user requests and display dynamic web pages.
- Implement forms to handle user input and validate data.
- Incorporate authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to specific features or content.
- Build a RESTful API using Django REST Framework to provide data services.
- Deploy your Django application to a production server for public access.

# Django REST API Repository

This repository contains the code and project files for the "Django REST API" project.

## Repository Structure

The repository structure is as follows:

- `api/`: Contains the Django project and application files for the REST API.
  - `settings.py`: Django project settings file.
  - `urls.py`: Main URL configuration file for the project.
  - `asgi.py`: ASGI application entry point.
  - `wsgi.py`: WSGI application entry point.
- `core/`: Contains the Django application files for the core functionality of the REST API.
  - `models.py`: Defines the data models used in the API.
  - `serializers.py`: Handles the serialization and deserialization of model instances.
  - `views.py`: Defines the API views and their corresponding actions.
  - `urls.py`: URL configuration for the application.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: Provides information about the project and instructions for usage.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tejayy/Django-RESTAPI.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your local development environment and configure the necessary database settings.

4. Start the development server by running the following command:

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

5. Access the API endpoints by visiting `http://localhost:8000/api/` in your web browser.

## Usage

The Django REST API provides a set of endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on a specific resource. You can use tools like `curl` or API testing tools like Postman to interact with the API.

The available endpoints include:

- `GET /api/profile/`: Retrieves a list of resources.
- `POST /api/profile/`: Creates a new resource.
- `GET /api/profile/{id}/`: Retrieves a specific resource by its ID.
- `PUT /api/profile/{id}/`: Updates a specific resource by its ID.
- `DELETE /api/profile/{id}/`: Deletes a specific resource by its ID.

Make sure to replace `resource` with the actual resource name defined in the API.
